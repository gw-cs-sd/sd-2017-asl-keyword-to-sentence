myoSign
=============

ASL Keyword to Sentence is an interface to help making signing easier for individual ASL users and convert a string of keywords into full sentences. The first component involves using a hand-gesture recognition device (the Myo Armband) to learn ASL signs and be able to convert these gestures into text. The second component involves converting keywords to full sentences (i.e. "take dog outside" will convert to "I will take the dog outside"). Together these two components will help ASL signers to make any ASL-text conversion much easier.
